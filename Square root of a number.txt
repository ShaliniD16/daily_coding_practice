Square root of a number

Given an integer x, find the square root of x. If x is not a perfect square, then return floor(âˆšx).

 

Example 1:

Input:
x = 5
Output: 2
Explanation: Since, 5 is not a perfect 
square, floor of square_root of 5 is 2.
Example 2:

Input:
x = 4
Output: 2
Explanation: Since, 4 is a perfect 
square, so its square root is 2.

class Solution
{
     long floorSqrt(long x)
	 {
		// Your code here
		if(x==0 || x==1) return x;
		long left = 1,right = x/2,mid,mid_sq,ans=0;
		while(left<=right){
		    mid = (left+right)/2;
		    mid_sq = mid*mid;
		    if(mid_sq == x) return mid;
		    else if(mid_sq<x){
		        left = mid+1;
		        ans = mid;
		    }
		    else{
		        right = mid-1;
		    }
		}
		return ans;
	 }
