Queue using two Stacks

Implement a Queue using 2 stacks s1 and s2 .
A Query Q is of 2 Types
(i) 1 x (a query of this type means  pushing 'x' into the queue)
(ii) 2   (a query of this type means to pop element from queue and print the poped element)

Note :- If there is no element return -1 as answer while popping.

Examples :

Input:
5
1 2 1 3 2 1 4 2
Output: 
2 3
Explanation: 
In the first testcase
1 2 the queue will be {2}
1 3 the queue will be {2 3}
2   poped element will be 2 the queue 
    will be {3}
1 4 the queue will be {3 4}
2   poped element will be 3.
Input:
4
1 2 2 2 1 4
Output: 
2 -1
Explanation: 
In the second testcase 
1 2 the queue will be {2}
2   poped element will be 2 and 
    then the queue will be empty
2   the queue is empty and hence -1
1 4 the queue will be {4}.
Expected Time Complexity : O(1) for push() and O(N) for pop() or O(N) for push() and O(1) for pop()  
Expected Auxilliary Space : O(1).

Constraints:
1 <= Q <= 100
1 <= x <= 100


class StackQueue
{
    Stack<Integer> s1 = new Stack<Integer>();
    Stack<Integer> s2 = new Stack<Integer>();

    //Function to push an element in queue by using 2 stacks.
    void Push(int x)
    {
	   // Your code here
	   s1.push(x);
    }
	
    
    //Function to pop an element from queue by using 2 stacks.
    int Pop()
    {
	   // Your code here
	   if(s1.isEmpty() && s2.isEmpty()) return -1;
	   if(s2.isEmpty()){
	       while(!s1.isEmpty()){
	           s2.push(s1.pop());
	       }
	   }
	   return s2.pop();
    }
