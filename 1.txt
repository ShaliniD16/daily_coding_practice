If the employee does not respond at all after long pressing the sos button it will be treated as an emergency and the alert will be sent.  This is the first feature. 2) Safe walk - When an employee feels unsafe while going home alone, they use this feature, where an AI will talk to that person until they reach home and the user will respond. If the user does not respond for some specified period of time, it will be treated as an emergency and the alert will be sent to the preferred person and the manager of the organization.  Sometime, the user might travel in a shared mode of transport like a bus.  In this situation the user might feel shy to talk with the AI. So the user should have the option to chat with AI.
